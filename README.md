Nigeria's population is growing at an unprecedented pace of 2.4 percent per year, with the majority of people living in slums and shantytowns, boosting the demand for handymen. Although Nigeria has a thriving informal sector comprised of part-time or freelance handymen, the country's economy is not structured at the national level to offer users with excellent service. Finding handyman service providers may be challenging, especially when traveling or moving to a new location, because service providers are spread out over different locations and provide varied pricing, quality, and types of services. Existing solutions aimed at solving this issue are fragmented, offering contacts spread throughout the internet, some of which are not genuine and wind up being fraudsters acting as handyman providers. The purpose of the project is to develop a platform where all handyman service providers can show case their services and clients can easily request and hire a handyman.
